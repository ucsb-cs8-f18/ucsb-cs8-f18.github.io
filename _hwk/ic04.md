Disregard the instruction above about "homework buddies" for this in-class assignment.  For this assignment:
* Collaborating with your neighbor is allowed and encouraged
* Asking for help from the professor is allowed and encouraged

Those conditions will NOT be true on the final exam.  This is just for practice.

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:14em"> (20 pts) Write the definition of a Python function `maskedPassword` that takes one parameter `pw` and returns a string consisting of the first three characters contained in the variable `pw` followed by 'x's instead of the remaining characters in `pw`.  The length of the returned value should be the same as the length of the parameter passed in. If the length of `pw` is less than 3 return `pw` without any modification (YOU MAY ASSUME `pw` is of type `str`)
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:0em"> Write three test cases (in the style of the `pytest` module) that for the function `maskedPassword` as defined above.

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:12em"> (20 pts) Write the definition of a Python function `isValidPassword` that takes a parameter `pw` and returns True if the variable `pw` is of type `str` and is a valid **password**, according to the following rules: it must consist of at least 8 characters, include one of the special characters `*` or `#` and terminate with a numeric digit (`0`-`9`).

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:20em"> (30 pts) Write the definition of a Python function `minOfTwoLists` that takes two lists as parameters: `alist` and `blist`. The functions returns a new list where each element in the new list is the minimum of the
corresponding elements in `alist` and `blist`. The function should raise a `ValueError` exception with an appropriate message, if either `alist` or `blist` is not a list or if either of them contains anything
other than numbers (either int or float) or if the two lists are not of the same length.
