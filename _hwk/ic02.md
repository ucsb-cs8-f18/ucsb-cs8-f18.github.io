<b>THE FINE PRINT:</b> This worksheet is to be completed in lab on 10/17.   If you complete
it in lab and turn it in, it will be graded and available online for you to
refer to by 5pm Saturday 10/21/2017.

If you miss lab this day, you can make this assignment up ONLY by completing
it and turning it in one week from today, during lab on 10/24/2017.
Failing to turn it in then will result in it being one of your zeros
(remember that you get to drop four of them.)

<li markdown="1"> Please look over the instructions for project01 at <http://ucsb-cs8-f17.github.io/lab/project01> and then plan out your tree by answering the following question

Have a TA or instructor review your work.  Then you can use it as a basis to code your solution to project01.   There are more grids on the back for part c (in case you spoil one of them and need to start over). If you use more than one grid please mark which one you would like to be graded. Your first task is to determine the coordinates of the four corners of a bounding box for your tree. Assume that the bottom left corner of the bounding box is `(startX, startY)` which is also the position of the turtle when your drawTree() function is called. You are only given the starting location of the turtle `(startX, startY)` and the height of the tree: `height`. Notice that you can choose any width for the tree that scales with the height of the tree (taller trees must be wider)

a. (15 pts) Fill in the blanks on the next page to determine the width of the tree in terms of the height and the coordinates for the top right corner (topRightX, topRightY) and the bottom right corner (bottomRightX, bottomRightY) of the bounding box. The coordinates for the top and bottom right corners must be expressed in terms of: `startX`, `startY`, `width` and `height`

b. (5 pts) Label the coordinates of the points in the given diagram (4 corners of the bounding box) as `(startX, startY)`, `(topLeftX, topLeftY)`, `(topRightX, topRightY)`, `(bottomRightX, bottomRightY)`
