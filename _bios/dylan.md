bio: >
   Hey everyone! My name is Dylan and my pronouns are he/him/his. I'm a second year in Computer Science major and I'm super
   excited to be a mentor for everyone this quarter. This fall, I'm starting research in Computer Architecture under Prof.    
   Sheerwood and Mirza. This is my first time being a mentor, so I'm extremely excited to join everyone on their first 
   voyage into computer science. Besides for progamming, I'm extremely active within our local labor movement and enjoy 
   studying the political economy in my free time. To learn more and be successful in this course, I highly recommend taking 
   advantage of office hours as you never know what you might learn inside them. Otherwise, feel free to contact me and ask me 
   any questions   you may have!
